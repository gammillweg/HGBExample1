# HGBExample1
HGBExample1:  Basic Example of how to create a hive with HGB classes

Very little code in the main Activity to initialize and generate a hive.
And a few lines of code to demonstrate that the hive exists.
This example does not draw the hive.

Only the main Activity has been uploaded, as it is the only file changed from
Android Studio's new project with a blank activity template.

Repositories yet to be written (each build will build on the previous)
TBD:  HGBExample2:  Will draw the hive; but do little else
TBD:  HGBExample3:  Will translate the hive and change cell size (via a menu pick)
TBD:  HGBExample4:  Will locate a cell and fill it with a color

The code for all of the above exists in repository HGB:HGBExample.zip.  But HGBExample.zip
is somewhat overburdened.  It is salvaged code form a game I worked on.  The examples
TBD above will be clean with better comments and specific to the task.

But there is one problem:  I am but one person.  Currently I am not devoting much
time to this project.  It may be some time before these repositories exist.
