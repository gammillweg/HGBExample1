# HGBExample1
HGBExample1:  Basic Example of how to create a hive with HGB classes

Very little code in the main Activity to initialize and generate a hive.
And a few lines of code to demonstrate that the hive exists.
This example does not draw the hive.

My first though was:  I need only upload the main Activity; but later I
decided it would be a better example if the entire project was available.

Repositories yet to be written (each build will build on the previous)

TBD:  HGBExample3:  Will translate the hive and locate a chosen cell (and
fill with a color).

The code for all of the above exists in repository HGB:HGBExample.zip.  But HGBExample.zip
is somewhat overburdened.  It is salvaged code form a game I worked on.  The examples
TBD above will be clean with better comments and specific to the task.

But there is one problem:  I am but one person.  Currently I am not devoting much
time to this project.  It may be some time before these repositories exist.
