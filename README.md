HGBExample1:  Basic Example of how to create a hive with HGB classes

This is a useless example.  BUT it demonstrates how easily, in just a
few lines one can create a HGB hive.  All the the hexagon data exists,
it is just drawn and thus is not visible.

All the work, what little the is of it, is found in the main Activity.

See HGBExample2 for a much more complex example that draws the hive
and demonstrates things like translation and cell location.
